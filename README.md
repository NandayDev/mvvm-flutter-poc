# Flutter MVVM Proof of Concept

Proof-of-concept for Flutter with an MVVM architecture, with repository and dependency injection.

Would not use in production, since it uses some beta packages (riverpod, for instance).

The app is currently only working on Android (had no iPhone available to test it).
